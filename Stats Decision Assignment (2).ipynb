In other words, the prices during these seasons in 2016 seemed pretty similar based on our analysis at a 5% significance level. So, to put it simply, the prices of houses sold in the summer months of 2016 were statistically similar to those sold in the winter months of the same year. This suggests that, according to our data and analysis, there wasn't a noticeable difference in property prices between these seasons in 2016."

This tells us that a good chunk of the available properties in Abbotsford are probably homes with precisely 2 bathrooms. This info is handy for people thinking about buying a home or interested in real estate in Abbotsford, as it gives them an idea of what kind of properties are likely to be available in terms of bathroom count."
